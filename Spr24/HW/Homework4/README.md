You can run the tests by running the following command in the terminal:

```
smlnj hw4_q[i]_tests.sml
```

You may notice that the first line in the test file is `use ...`, which means that your solution file must be accessible in the working directory. If you have your solution in a different directory, you can change the path in the test file.
