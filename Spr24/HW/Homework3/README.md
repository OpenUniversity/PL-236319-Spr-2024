Note that question 3 does not have an input/output file. Instead, it has a testing code file that runs some tests.
You can run the test by running the following command in the terminal:

```
smlnj test_parse.sml
```

You may notice that the first line in the test file is `use "hw3_q3.sml"`, which means that your solution file must be accessible in the working directory. If you have your solution in a different directory, you can change the path in the test file.
